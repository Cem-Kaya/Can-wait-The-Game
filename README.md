# Can Wait: THE GAME

"Can Wait" is a 2D roguelike multiplayer game that utilizes a client-server architecture for networked cooperative play. This game integrates advanced procedural generation for map and room layouts through the wave function collapse algorithm and employs A* pathfinding for validation checks to ensure every generated space is navigable and interesting.

## Key Features

- **Procedural Generation:** Utilizes the wave function collapse algorithm for dynamic map and room generation.
- **Multiplayer Experience:** Designed with a server-client architecture to support cooperative gameplay.
- **AI and Pathfinding:** Incorporates A* algorithms to ensure all generated maps are functional and challenging.
- **Synchronization:** Implements distributed barriers for effective state management across networked environments.

## Development Practices and Technologies

### Agile Development with Scrum

- **Sprint Duration:** Adapts a Scrum framework with 2-4 day sprints for rapid iteration and flexibility.
- **Backlog Management:** Maintains a dynamic and responsive project backlog to quickly adapt to feedback.
- **Pair Programming:** Enhances code quality and team collaboration through integrated pair programming.

### Technology Stack

- **Game Engine:** Unity Game Engine.
- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022 with Live Share.
- **Programming Language:** C#.
- **Networking:** NetCode for GameObjects to manage networked interactions.
- **Synchronization:** Parallel Sync and distributed barriers for state consistency.
- **AI Development:** AI agents with percepts and memory.
- **Asset Creation:** Stable Diffusion and DALLÂ·E 2 for generating unique assets.
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Image Editing:** GIMP for asset refinement.

## Network Optimization
